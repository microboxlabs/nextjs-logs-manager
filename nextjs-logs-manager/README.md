# MicroboxLabs Fullstack Challenge: Logs Ingestion and Viewing

This application allows MicroboxLabs to manage system logs efficiently through features like **log uploading**, **viewing**, and **filtering**. It was built using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Flowbite**. Below is the comprehensive documentation for the project.

---

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

The application addresses the need to ingest and visualize logs for different microservices, including role-based access control for Admin and Regular users.

**Core Features**:

1. **Admin users** can upload log files for processing.
2. **Regular users** can view logs and apply advanced filters.
3. Logs are displayed in a responsive table with pagination.
4. Filters include date range, log levels, and service names.

## 🔧 **Core Features and Implementation**

### **1. Log Upload (Admin Only)**

- **API Endpoint**: `/api/log/upload`
- Logs are uploaded via a plain text file and parsed into a structured format:

  ```log
  [2024-11-01 10:00:00] [INFO] Service-A: Successfully completed task.
  ```

### **2. Viewing Logs**

- Logs are displayed using a **DataTable** component.
- **Columns**: Timestamp, Log Level, Service Name, Message.
- **Pagination**: Table supports pagination for large datasets.

### **3. Filtering Logs**

- **Date Range**: Filter logs by start and end dates.
- **Log Level**: Select `INFO`, `WARNING`, or `ERROR`.
- **Service Name**: Filter logs by the generating service.

### **4. Role-Based Access Control**

- Admin users can upload logs.
- Regular users can only view and filter logs.
- Authentication managed by **NextAuth.js**.

## 🌟 **Optional Enhancements**

- **Real-Time Updates**: Implemented with Server-Sent Events (SSE).

## **Bonus**

### Real-Time Log Updates with SSE

To enhance user experience, the application leverages Server-Sent Events (SSE) to stream newly ingested logs to connected clients in real time.

#### How it Works

- **SSE Endpoint**: A server endpoint (`/api/log/events`) establishes a persistent connection with clients.
- **Broadcasting**: When logs are ingested (uploaded), they are parsed and broadcasted to all connected clients.
- **UI Update**: Clients receive new log entries in real time without needing a manual page refresh.

This implementation provides a seamless and dynamic log monitoring experience for users.
